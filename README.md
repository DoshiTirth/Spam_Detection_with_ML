## Introduction
Email spam poses a major threat by exposing users to scams, phishing, and malware. Current filters often fail, leading to misclassified emails. This project aims to create a more reliable spam detection system using machine learning to develop a more dependable spam detection system.

## Dataset
- Source: Spam Dataset
- The dataset contains labeled email messages with the following labels:
      - spam: Unwanted messages.
      - ham: Legitimate messages.
- Preprocessing Steps:
      - Dropped unnecessary columns.
      - Removed null values.
      - Applied lemmatization and stopword removal to clean the text data.
